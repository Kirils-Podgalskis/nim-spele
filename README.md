Welcome the game of Nim!
======================
This is a simple game of Nim. The rules are as follows:
1. There are 3 piles of stones.
2. Each player takes turns removing stones from the piles.
3. On a player's turn, they must remove at least 1 stone, and may remove any number of stones from any single pile.
4. The player who removes the last stone wins.

Your opponent is a computer, and it will always play optimally. Computer chooses optimal move by using minimax algorithm.

You can play the game by running `python3 main.py` in the terminal.
